  conclusion: "The ALN Quantum Compliance Calculator provides mathematically rigorous, auditable compliance scoring that transcends classical binary pass/fail assessments. By encoding policies as quantum operators and data as tensors, the framework captures complex regulatory requirements with continuous gradients enabling optimization. The auditability vector identifies high-impact remediation priorities, while quantum resistance metrics future-proof systems against emerging threats. Integration with ALN's procedural asset generation ensures compliance is enforced at synthesis time, not merely validated post-facto. This transforms compliance from reactive burden to proactive architectural principle, positioning ALN as the superior choice for policy-native programming in regulated industries."
