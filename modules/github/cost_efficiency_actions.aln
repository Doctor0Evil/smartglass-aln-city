      savings_estimate: 55% CI trigger reduction
    - block: REPO_STATISTICS_SNAPSHOTS
      desc: Save statistics daily in ALN; reduce on-demand API sampling for dashboards.

      savings_estimate: 15-20% billing cost reduction
    - block: CACHED_WEBHOOK_RESPONSES
      desc: Respond to common webhooks with ALN-cached data.

      savings_estimate: 30% webhook API savings
    - block: BATCH_PAGINATED_LOG_EXPORTS
      desc: Use ALN-manifested export jobs to bundle logs/data after-hours.
      impact: Avoid real-time API cost spikes for log retrieval.
      savings_estimate: 35% log export cost reduction
    - block: DEIDENTIFIED_AUDIT_LOGS
      desc: Process logs through ALN locally to strip PII before external analysis.
      impact: Reduce outbound API traffic for compliance processing.
      savings_estimate: 25% audit API reduction
    - block: DEPLOY_FROM_MANIFEST
      desc: Trigger CI/CD from local ALN deployment manifests.
      impact: Eliminate remote hook API pings.
      savings_estimate: 40% deployment trigger reduction
    - block: SEMAPHORE_JOB_LOCKING
      desc: ALN-based locks prevent redundant job stacking.
      impact: Stop extra API executions from duplicate triggers.
      savings_estimate: 50% duplicate job prevention
    - block: SELF_HEALING_ROLLBACKS
      desc: Locally coordinate rollback with ALN manifest hashes.
      impact: Avoid unnecessary rollback API calls.
      savings_estimate: 30% rollback API savings
    - block: TEMPORAL_USAGE_REPORTING

  compliance_hooks:
    - audit: Summarize every avoided API call with projected cost reduction in immutable ledger.
    - alert: Escalate if API usage trends exceed ALN-optimized baseline by >15%.
