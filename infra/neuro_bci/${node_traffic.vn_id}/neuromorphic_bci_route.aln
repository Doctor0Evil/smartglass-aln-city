[neuromorphic_bci_route]
Processes input:
    - node_traffic: object (virtual node packet stream, metadata labels)
    - bci_signal: array<float> (brain-computer interface signal values)
Generates output:
    - adaptive_route: object (path determination, synaptic weights, timestamp)
Implements protocol (learning mechanism):
    - Learns via STDP (spike-timing dependent plasticity, neural adaptation technique)
    - Secures with local trust anchor, node attestation (verification process)
Sets dest-path: /infra/neuro_bci/${node_traffic.vn_id}/
Enforces logging:
    - Ensures compliance with WIPO (world intellectual property organization), patent logs
    - Stores logs at: /audit/neuro_bci/${node_traffic.vn_id}/
Manages lifecycle: continuous self-learning, retrain events, online updates
Enforces security_policy: neuro-channel isolation (signal separation), access gating
