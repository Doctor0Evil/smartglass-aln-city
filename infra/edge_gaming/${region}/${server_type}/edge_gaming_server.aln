[edge_gaming_server]
Processes input:
    - region: string (geographic area or zone)
    - server_type: enum [game (core gameplay), lobby (player gathering), matchmaker (pairing service), relay (data forwarding)]
Generates output:
    - optimized_placement: object (node assignment, ping profile, available capacity)
Implements protocol (orchestration mechanism):
    - Orchestrates using k-means clustering + latency/availability optimization (machine learning algorithm for grouping)
    - Monitors real-time RTT (round-trip time), load balancing, abuse detection
    - Handles failover: auto-migrates to best available node
Sets dest-path: /infra/edge_gaming/${region}/${server_type}/
Enforces logging:
    - Ensures compliance with DMCA (digital millennium copyright act)
    - Stores logs at: /audit/edge_gaming/${region}/
Activates monitoring: live latency tracking, abuse signature detection, geo-diversity checks
Applies backup_policy: incremental encrypted snapshots
Enforces security_policy: session tokenization (secure token handling), DDOS shield (distributed denial-of-service protection)
